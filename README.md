# gapminder-data-analysis

This project was completed in **CDS DS 100**, a course in Boston Universityâ€™s Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences.

**CDS** is the school code for the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences.  
**DS** stands for 'Data Science'.

**CDS DS 100** is formally known as [Data Speaks Louder Than Words](https://www.bu.edu/academics/cds/courses/cds-ds-100/).

This project was completed during the Spring 2022 semester under Professor Langdon White. Additionally, this was a group project, completed with one other Boston University student.

This project was not open-ended. Rather, the Professor provided us with the dataset and guidance regarding what type of analyses to conduct.
